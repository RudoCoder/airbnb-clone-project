Technology Stack
This project leverages a modern, full-stack technology ecosystem to simulate the architecture of a production-grade booking platform. Each tool or framework plays a specific role in building, managing, and deploying the application:

Django
Purpose: A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend of the application. It handles routing, business logic, user authentication, and serves RESTful and GraphQL APIs.

 MySQL
Purpose: A powerful relational database used to store structured application data, such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, and reviews.

 GraphQL
Purpose: An API query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making the application more efficient and flexible in fetching and updating data.

Django REST Framework (DRF)
Purpose: A toolkit built on Django for building robust RESTful APIs. Used alongside GraphQL for services that require REST compliance or simpler data exchange.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Purpose: A secure method for transmitting user authentication data between frontend and backend. Used for stateless, token-based authentication.

 Docker
Purpose: Used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

GitHub Actions
Purpose: Enables CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment of new code changes, ensuring stability and fast iteration.

 HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Purpose: Core frontend technologies used to build and style the user interface and ensure interactive client-side behavior.

Pytest / Unittest
Purpose: Frameworks for testing Django apps to ensure the correctness of backend functionality and catch bugs early in development.

 Postman
Purpose: A tool used for testing API endpoints and simulating client-server communication during development.
